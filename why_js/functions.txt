1) function definition
 .a js function is block of code designed to perform a particular task
 .before we use a function,we need to define it
 .a function definition(also called a function declaration,or function statement)
  consist of the function keyword,followed by:
 .the name of the function .
 .a list of parameters to the function,enclosed in parentheses and seperated by commas.
 .the javascript statements that define the function,enclosed in curly brackets

 general function syntax:
 function functionname(){
     statements
 }

2) calling function
  .defining a function does not execute it.
  .a javascript fucntion is executed when "something" invokes it 

Q) what is the difference between function parameter vs function definition
A) function parameters are the names listed in the fucntion's definition
   function arguments are the real values passed to the function

Q) why function?
A) you can reuse code:define the code once,and use its many times
   you can use the same code many times with different arguments,
   to produce different results

   or 

   a function is a group of reusable code which can be called anywhere
   in your program. this eliminates the need of writing the same code
   again and again

4) function expression
   function expression simply means create a function and put it into the variable

5) return keyword
   when js reaches a return statement
   the function will stop executing

   function often compute a return values
   the return value is returned back to the caller

6) anonymous function
   .a function expression is similar to and has the same syntax
    as a function declaration one can define "named "
    fucntion expression (where the name of the expression might
    be used in the call stack for example)
    or "anonymous" function expressions.
