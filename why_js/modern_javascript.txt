Q) ECMAscript
A) ECMAscript is a general purpose programming language,standardised by Ecma
   javascript is an implementation of an Ecma

Now its time for modern javascript ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ
ðŸ¤  features of ECMAscript 2015 also known as ES6

1) Let vs Const vs Var
  .In var we initialize ,update the same variable again and again 
  .the scope of js variable declared with var is its current execution context

  .the let statement declares local variable in a block scope.it is similar to var ,in that 
   we can optionally initialize the variable

   .const statement values can be assigned once and they cannot be reassigned
   .the scope statement works similar to let statements

2) template literals(template strings)  
   .Template literals are string literals allowing embedded expressions. You can use multi-line
    strings and string interpolation features with them.

3) arrow function
  .an arrow function expression is a compact alternative to a traditional function expression
   but is limited and can't used in all situation
  .if we need to use this or super keyword then we can't use arrow function
